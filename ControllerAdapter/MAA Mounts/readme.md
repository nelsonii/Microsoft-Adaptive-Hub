Mounts for the Microsoft Adaptive Hub's Accessories (joysticks).

Uses 1/4"-20 tee nuts, 3/8" in length.

Adjust model in OpenSCAD and render, as desired.

Note: In some of my models I use a "false bottom" -- basically, the print has some very thin layers at the bottom. This helps the slicer and printer -- they don't have to deal with circles right on the bed. Just punch out the holes -- they should clear very easily.
