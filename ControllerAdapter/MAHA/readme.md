My initial prototyping of MAHA (Microsoft Adaptive Hub Adapter). This one uses little screws instead of plastic tabs.

You'll need four M1.6-5 screws for the "pins". A M4-8 screw is used as the mounting screw (to the toppers).

Toppers use M4x6x6 brass inserts, heat pressed in.

OpenSCAD models are here, too, so you can modify sizing as desired.
